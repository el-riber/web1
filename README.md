Express Conditional Routing
This is a Node.js Express server implementing conditional routing.

Project Description
This project demonstrates how to create an Express server that utilizes conditional routing to serve different responses based on certain conditions. It includes route handlers for the path '/foo' that provide different responses randomly. Additionally, it handles undefined routes with a 404 error message.

Open a web browser and visit http://localhost:3008/foo to see the responses.

The response may vary between "sometimes this" and "and sometimes that" based on a random condition set in the /foo route handlers.
To test 404 error handling, visit undefined routes like http://localhost:3008/undefined_route. You should see a response with "404 - Not Found".

Implementation Details
The server is configured to listen on port 3000 by default, or on a port provided by the environment.
Two route handlers are implemented for the path '/foo'. The first handler randomly chooses between two responses, while the second handler returns a specific response.
Error handling is set up to return a 404 - Not Found response for undefined routes.
Dependencies
Express - Web framework for Node.js
